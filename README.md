# Timing

## Concept

This app is for helping you get a overview of how you spend your days. It is intended for developers working in agile projects, but it can of course be used by anyone who wants to get a better picture of how you spend your hours.

## Future functionality

In this first version you will have to enter your time slots individually and manually. There are ideas about connecting it to google calendar in the future to import your scheduled meetings from there and get an overview of how your time was spent.

### Technologies

- The app is built on `create-react-app` and using `styled-components` for styling.
- We implement `storybook` for generating a UI component library. Here's a great guide on how to get started: https://elijahmanor.com/cra-storybook/
